## GitHub (local publishing)
#
# Only needed if you run `pnpm forge:publish` locally.
# GitHub Actions uses `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` automatically.
#
# Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (classic) with `repo` scope (private repo),
# or fine-grained token with write access to Releases (public repo),
# then export it as GH_TOKEN.
